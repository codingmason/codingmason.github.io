		<p>Remember, certain, painful, and inevitable death is no excuse for poor planning! And although we all live in unimaginable squalor, we peasants are not without our resources. Here are the items that absolutely no peasant should be without when those black sails appear on the horizon.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A White Flag</strong> - Remember, "The white flag is the right flag for you." It's the universal symbol of unconditional surrender, which is exactly what you should be doing the second you hear those battle-drums in the distance. Most barbarians wouldn't know the rules of war even if you tattooed it across their foreheads; they can't read! But hey, it's worth a shot.

			<li><strong>Dirt!</strong> - It comprises over 80% of our diet anyway, why not use it to hide under? And if you're found and savagely butchered, then you've already saved your loved ones the trouble and expense of burying you. Win win!

			<li><strong>Nothing!</strong> - It's what you have the most of, it's what you have to live for, and ultimately it is what is going to save you from those hordes rampages across the plains.</li>
