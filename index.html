		<h3>Words of Wisdom from Old Man Jenkins, the Village Elder</h3>
			<blockquote>They say it takes a whole village to raise a child. But it only takes one child to raze a village. Seriously, a baby could set fire to this place. What are our defences? Mud? Sticks? Dysentery? It's no wonder we're getting sacked again! Goddamn good-fer-nothing whippersnappers! Why in my day, we had spine! We had gumption! We had &mdash; AGHHGH!!!! My femoral artery!!!! Goddamn arrows.... Aghghghhhhh! [UNINTELLIGIBLE] </blockquote>
