			<blockquote>They say it takes a whole village to raise a child. But it only takes one child to raze a village. Seriously, a baby could set fire to this place. What are our defenses? Mud? Sticks? Dysentery? It's no wonder we're getting sacked again! Gosh-darned good-fer-nothing whippersnappers! Why in my day, we had spine! We had gumption! We had &mdash; AGHHGH!!!! My femoral artery!!!! Goddamn arrows.... Aghghghhhhh! [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</blockquote>

<!--The concept of this page was to replicate the form of a field guide, like you'd have for plants or reptiles or somesuch. I looked at a few websites in this vein to see how they were organized, but the scope of my page (not to mention my meager HTML skills) meant that I couldn't really follow how they were built too closely. For instance, (https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/browse) is really cool, with a big grid of bird silhouettes arranged by type that link to lists of species that conform to that shape. The images as hyperlinks are a nice intuitive way to select things.-->
